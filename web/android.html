	<p>I started using Android since the Gingerbread (2.3.3). It was one of the most popular versions of Android which was pretty stable and smooth in terms of user experience. Being a fan of Android and all the Google services, I use it most of time in my life.</p>
	
	<p>Besides using the services, I also love to code and develop. I recently switched to Android Studio which is currently in beta and getting familiar with it. I haven't had any chance to publish any apps on Google Play Store till now but I am hoping to publish one very soon.</p>
	
	<p>P.S. Devices used: Samsung Galaxy y duos (S6102), Samsung Galaxy tab 2 7.0 (P3110), Google Nexus 5 (LG-D821)</p>
