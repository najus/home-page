	<p>Pictures are the only thing that remain unchanged. Everything else changes over time. Time changes situation, situation changes people, we change everything around us and yet the picture we took remains the same forever. That's why I love taking pictures.</p>

	<p>I take lots of pictures and share few of them on the world wide web. You can find some of those here.
