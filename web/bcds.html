	<p style="font-size:15px">This project was undertaken for the final year project of B.E in Computer Science. The system was developed in C# which used mammographic images as a
	source for analysing data. A total of 12 features (8 texture features based on GLCM and 4 statistical features) were extracted from the image to provide results using Neural Network.<p>
	
	<p align="centre" style="font-size:15px">The <a style='color:#DD4814'>'Breast Cancer Diagnosis System'</a> is concerned about the development of a system that can identify abnormal growth of cells in breast tissue
	and suggest further pathological test, if necessary. The objective of this system is to help the diagnosis process of breast cancer from mammographic images. The term 
	mammographic image refers to the digital X-ray image of human breast, more commonly female breast taken to experiment cancer on it. Breast cancer is one of the major causes 
	of death among women. It is a tumor that starts from breast tissue and it has become a most common mortality factor for women in the world. Small clusters of micro calcifications 
	appearing as collection of white spots on mammograms show an early warning of breast cancer. Even at this 21st century, there is no reliable way for breast cancer treatment. 
	This is why early detection of breast cancer is needed so that the patients can find the better options for medical treatment in early stages itself. Hence, we need a system
	that can decide whether you have cancer or not and this project aims at the diagnosis of abnormal masses present in the mammographic images.</p> 
	
	<p>A three layer feed forward neural network is designed for the diagnosis purpose. The first stage classifies a given mammographic image into cancerous or non-cancerous also called as Abnormal or Normal. The second
	stage classifies an abnormal mammographic image into one of the two types Benign or Malignant. The various features like texture features based on gray level co-occurrence matrix
	and statistical features are used for the classification purposes. The system is trained and tested with image samples provided by mammographic image analysis society. The overall
	classification rate is observed to be 64.3%.</p>
